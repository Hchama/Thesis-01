Histogram Bins: The histogram bins represent different color or intensity values. 
For example, in the case of a color histogram for an RGB image, 
each bin might represent a specific range of values for the Red, Green, or Blue color channels. 
In the case of a grayscale image, each bin represents a specific intensity value.

Frequency: The frequency in a histogram represents the number of pixels in the image that fall into each bin. 
It indicates how often a particular color or intensity value occurs in the image. 
Higher frequencies indicate that more pixels in the image have the corresponding color or intensity value, 
while lower frequencies indicate less common colors or intensity values.
